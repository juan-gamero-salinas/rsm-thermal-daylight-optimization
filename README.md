# rsm-thermal-daylight-optimization

This repository provides supplementary materials to reproduce the results outlined in the research preprint, *Response Surface Methodology coupled with desirability functions for multi-objective optimization: minimizing indoor overheating hours and maximizing useful daylight illuminance* (currently under review). The methodology is detailed in the accompanying R Markdown HTML and PDF files. Access the preprint on arXiv [here](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2409.09093). Additionally, the repository includes Rhino/Grasshopper simulation files to parametrically implement the thermal comfort and daylight simulations featured in the case study discussed in the paper.
