# rsm-thermal-daylight-optimization

This repository contains supplementary material for reproducing the results using the methodology described in the R Markdown HTML and PDF file of the research paper under review `Response Surface Methodology coupled with desirability functions for multi-objective optimization: minimizing indoor overheating and maximizing daylight.`

Additionally, it also contains Rhino/Grasshopper simulation files for implementing parametrically the thermal comfort and daylight simulations of the case study explained on the paper.
